// of open files will increase by 4 or 6 or so for each network
// connection. With the default `ulimit -a` of 1024 open files,
// this should work OK (including open files for the logger, the
// databases, etc.).
//
// July 2019 - change to 10. When it is 60, it just thrashes like
// crazy, mostly because there are 60 threads thrashing in guile
// on some lock. And that's pretty pointless...
