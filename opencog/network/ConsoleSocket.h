/**
 * This class implements the ServerSocket that handles the primary
 * interface of the server: the plain text command line.
 *
 * There may be multiple instances of ConsoleSocket to support multiple
 * simultaneous clients. This is done by creating a separate thread and
 * dispatching a client socket for each client that connects to the
 * server socket.
 *
 * We provide a callback method: 'OnRequestCompleted()'. This callback
 * tells the server socket that request processing has finished (so that
 * the command prompt can be sent to the client immediately, while the
 * request itself is processed 'asynchronously'.

    // closed socket, and ServerSocket::handle_connection() exits it's
    // loop, and then tries to destruct this class and exit the thread
    // that has been handling the socket i/o. We have to hold off this
    // destruction, until all of the users of this class have completed
    // thier work. We accomplish this with a use-count: each in-flight
    // request increments the use-count, and then decrements it when done.
    // The destructor can run only when the use-count has dropped to zero.

    // Sockets with a shell on them will typically have a use-count of
    // zero already; these use a different method of holding off the dtor.

    // ServerSocket::handle_connection() invokes this dtor.
